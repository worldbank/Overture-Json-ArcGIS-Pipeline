OvertureLink Pipeline Components

This module provides the core pipeline architecture following the Source → Transform → Publish/Export pattern.

Components:
- source: OvertureSource for data ingestion (DuckDB + dump management)
- transform: Transformer for schema normalization and data transformation
- publish: FeatureLayerManager for ArcGIS Online publishing
- export: Exporter for multi-format export (GeoJSON, GPKG, FGDB)
